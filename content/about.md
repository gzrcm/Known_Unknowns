Hello Internet! I'm **Jacob**, a professional Intelligence Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist. I help decision-makers connect the dots between their business goals and realisation using practical statistical methods and heuristic process design. I could bore you with lots of details about me, but why not show instead of tell. Check out my [**projects**](/projects/) page to see some of my skills in action. To learn more about my work and how it could help you check out my [**How we Work**](/Work_files/How we Work.pdf) methodology. Or if you want to contact me and have a chat, just [**email**](mailto:jb@knownunknowns.co.uk).
