            <p>Hello folks, we are going to start doing this differently. I figured if I don’t like lengthy diatribe articles, neither do you. So we will be splitting the blog into a Too Long; Didn’t Read (TL;DR) section and Too Short; Want More! (TS;WM) section. I figure that serves a twofold purpose: I get better at writing intelligence BLUF’s (Bottom Line up Front), but I have rant and rave like a crazy person in the rest without burdening you.</p>

            <p>The concept of a black box was developed in the 1940’s as a device that recorded the various readings of aircraft instruments. The purpose was to be accessible in the event of a crash so that investigators could understand the conditions leading to the tragedy in the hopes of learning how to avoid it in the future. Today we often see it in the context of decision-making, usually associated with shadowy “Artificial Intelligence” and “Algorithmic Learning,” all that techy stuff that journalists and politicians don’t get some times.</p>

            <p>Harking back to our golden tri-force of process, product and culture I wanted to discuss today; process. And like a high school level research paper let’s start with a google definition:
“[Process] is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.”
That’s pretty straight forward. You could compare it to a function in mathematics, given an input \(A\) how do you get to output \(B\).</p>

Look at the diagram below, Full credit to Dr. Philip Lee Miller who created it. Can we say that the “mean” is representative of this population? Well, no.
Todd Rose from the Star wrote an excellent piece on the history of this problem using the US fighter pilots example.</p>

In case you didn’t know, I used to work in Canadian Politics, which compared to the rest of the world (especially these days) is quite tame. But politics is something I am passionate about. I like to think of myself as civilly minded democrat committed to reflecting the will of the people into robust and positive policy. Others might disagree, you know who you are ;).</p>

            <p>Douglas Hubbard was famous for saying, “you need less data than you think you do, and you have more data than you think you have.” I generally agree with. Simple models that explain simple issue are always favoured over the more complex black-box models that are all signing and all dancing.
But what happens when we disregard Hubbard’s adage? This is where leveraging happens. Incorrect data is used in inappropriate ways and extrapolated to fill gaps it should not.</p>

I don’t like to dwell on the image, but when we are young we cannot conceive of long term plans or consequences. To borrow a term from my high history teacher, “you are here to learn how to be adults.</p>

I will preface this with I hate doing analysis in Excel, but the world’s most prolific software isn’t going anytime soon. To be fair, most people are comfortable with it so that is what we will discuss in this post.
What I always recommend to people is they treat their analysis as thee distinct parts.</p>

            <p>What are you trying to do? That’s a question I have to ask clients all too often. This is typically necessitated for one of two reasons: the decision-maker assumes I know something I do not that would help clarify the problem, or more likely the requirements have been poorly articulated. Requirements that are critical to actually doing intelligence. Otherwise we all stumble aimlessly in the dark looking for success.</p>
