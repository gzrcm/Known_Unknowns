<h1>Experiance</h1></p>

<p><strong>Kent Police</strong><br />
<em>Dec 2016 to present</em></p>

<p>For the past 18 months I have been assisting the Kent Police in designing and delivering a risk measurement system for gangs intelligence using a Multi-criteria Decision Making method (MCDM). This system has resulting in a significant time saving in data collation, a streamlined and normalised data structure for analysis and greater insight into who is the greatest risk to citizens of Kent and what that risk looks like.</p>

<p><strong>Nursing and Midwifery Council</strong><br />
<em>Jan 2018 to present</em></p>

<p>Working for the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the worlds largest professional regulator, to develop intelligence systems for risk measuring and mitigation, including; creation of a open source data-base to collect, normalise and deliver a steam of information to intelligence officers, creation of a pilot analysis to identify health-care trust level interventions for learning, applying Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to the organisations revalidation program to identify risk in registrant applications, working with other system regulars to develop a UK wide geographical information system for geospatial analysis and consistency in information sharing.</p>

<p><strong>Moat Homes</strong><br />
<em>Dec 2015 to Dec 2017</em></p>

<p>As a social house regulator Moat had to maintain an aggressive development strategy while ensuring that is effectively collected rent and avoided the risk of arrears. Our team assisted in developed a more robust customer feedback system that provided real-time transactional feedback generated from our customer service team to ensure a better relationship with customers. This feedback was captured, parsed and analysed for sentiment, topics and key words. Designed a decision system to drive down responsive repairs by use of component replacement investigations</p>

<p><strong>CPI</strong><br />
<em>Oct 2013 to Dec 2015</em></p>

<p>Utilised intelligence to recover a 17M CHF case out-of-court between parties from Europe and Asia. Used various intelligence techniques to successfully resolve a $6M USD civil case brought to the UK courts from the USA, where a business had misrepresented the extent of their technology and refused to pay back a capital loan.</p>
