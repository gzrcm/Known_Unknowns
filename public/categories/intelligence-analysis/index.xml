      <title>The Black Box</title>

      <description>The concept of a black box was developed in the 1940’s as a device that recorded the various readings of aircraft instruments. The purpose was to be accessible in the event of a crash so that investigators could understand the conditions leading to the tragedy in the hopes of learning how to avoid it in the future. Today we often see it in the context of decision-making, usually associated with shadowy “Artificial Intelligence” and “Algorithmic Learning,” all that techy stuff that journalists and politicians don’t get some times.</description>

      <description>Harking back to our golden tri-force of process, product and culture I wanted to discuss today; process. And like a high school level research paper let’s start with a google definition:
“[Process] is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.”
That’s pretty straight forward. You could compare it to a function in mathematics, given an input \(A\) how do you get to output \(B\).</description>

      <description>Back again! And what a month we have had in the UK. In case you didn’t know, I used to work in Canadian Politics, which compared to the rest of the world (especially these days) is quite tame. But politics is something I am passionate about. I like to think of myself as civilly minded democrat committed to reflecting the will of the people into robust and positive policy. Others might disagree, you know who you are ;).</description>

      <description>I feel like I make a lot of school days’ comparisons, asking readers to harken back to their teenage years when their unbridled dreams stretched to weekend plans and maybe getting a summer job. I don’t like to dwell on the image, but when we are young we cannot conceive of long term plans or consequences. To borrow a term from my high history teacher, “you are here to learn how to be adults.</description>

      <title>What are you Trying to do?</title>

      <description>What are you trying to do? That’s a question I have to ask clients all too often. This is typically necessitated for one of two reasons: the decision-maker assumes I know something I do not that would help clarify the problem, or more likely the requirements have been poorly articulated. Requirements that are critical to actually doing intelligence. Otherwise we all stumble aimlessly in the dark looking for success.</description>

      <title>Brain Failures</title>

      <description>There is a great clip online of Neil deGrasse Tyson describing optical illusions as “Brain Failures.” Like most of Tyson’s appearances its played for laughs while secretly teaching you about science, but analysts know this true. So true in fact that the great Richard Heuer wrote a manual for the CIA on how to over come cognitive bias called the Psychology of Intelligence Analysis.
Heuer explores “brain failures” by dichotomizing the causes and exploring the effects.</description>

      <description>One of the best visualisations of intelligence management I was exposed to during my MSc at Mercyhurst University was the concept of intelligence as three distinct powers; process, product and culture. When arranged in a diagram, as below, form the foundation for proper intelligence (yes, it looks like a tri-force from Legend of Zelda and that is an apt description).

Instead of focusing on the product exclusively, the intelligence tri-force image equally balances the process of making decisions, the product design itself and finally, how we as analysts influence organisational culture for the better.</description>

      <title>The Analyst Toothbrush</title>

      <description>Anyone that has ever worked in coding or analysis dreads picking up the work of a colleague without being included from the initial scope. Why? Because our brains are like unique software, each with their own processes, hardware, verifications, etc. Stepping into someone else’s analysis is hard and can be incompatible with our cognitive machinery. I liken it to using someone else’s tooth brush. Yeah, tooth brushes are all the same and perform the same function, but your tooth brush is yours.</description>

      <description>As Albert Einstein said, “As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it.” Ironically the more we learn the less we realise we know. It is that simple and humbling thought that attracted me, in part, to intelligence analysis. The idea that our hubris is a demonstration of ignorance, but acknowledgment of ignorance has a certain awe associated with it. What I imagine is close a religious experience.</description>
