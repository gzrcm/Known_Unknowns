      <description>First off, a sincere thank you to all front line medical works across the globe, particularly the NHS. You are all heros in the face of a dangerous situation and your contribution is felt by your patients and the public alike. We can never repay you for the sacrifices you are making and we all pray an event like this will never be seen again. To everyone else, ff you are so moved, why not join the NHS Volunteer Army and help save lives today!</description>
