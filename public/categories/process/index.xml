      <description>One of the best visualizations of intelligence management I was exposed to during my MSc at Mercyhurst University was the concept of intelligence as three distinct powers; process, product and culture. When arranged in a diagram as above form the foundation for proper intelligence (yes, it looks like a tri-force from Legend of Zelda and that is an apt description).
Instead of focusing on the product, the intelligence tri-force image equally balances the process of making decisions, the product design itself and finally, how we as analysts influence organisational culture for the better.</description>
